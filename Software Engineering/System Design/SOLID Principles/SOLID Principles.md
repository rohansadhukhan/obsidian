## Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one responsibility.
[[S - Single Responsibility Principle]]

## Open/Closed Principle

Software entities (such as classes, modules, and functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
[[O - Open Close Principle]]




## Liskov Substitution Principle

Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.


## Interface Segregation Principle

A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use


## Dependency Inversion Principle

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
