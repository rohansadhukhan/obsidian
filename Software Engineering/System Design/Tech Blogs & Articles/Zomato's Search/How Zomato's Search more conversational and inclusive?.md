### Problem Statement

- People can search for a dish, a restaurant, or a cuisine. Such as searching for 'a burger', 'Restaurant XYZ', or 'North Indian' and so on. 
- Search box is an open text box and customers search for more than one item together or queries with complex searches such as ***burger from XYZ restaurant*** or ***pizza under INR 200*** or ***pizza dominos***. In cases like these, search engines become more than just indexing entities
